        <p><em>Exhale</em>, designed by Sisan and Seyi, stems from a desire to make <em><strong>mindfulness</strong></em> accessible to everyone.</p>
        <p>In mindfulness practice, we are learning how to return to, and remain in, the present momentâ€”to anchor ourselves in the here and now on purpose, without judgment.</p>
        <p>Through mindful living practices, we can find more happiness, joy, and meaning in our lives.</p>
